# Randomized Algorithms
Author : Rohan Lagare
A randomized algorithm is an algorithm that employs a degree of randomness as part of its logic or procedure. The algorithm typically uses uniformly random bits as an auxiliary input to guide its behavior, in the hope of achieving good performance in the "average case" over all possible choices of random determined by the random bits; thus either the running time, or the output (or both) are random variables.

Las Vegas algorithms : algorithms that use the random input so that they always terminate with the correct answer, but where the expected running time is finite, for example Quicksort 
Monte Carlo algorithms : algorithms which have a chance of producing an incorrect result or fail to produce a result either by signaling a failure or failing to terminate, for example algorithm for the MFAS problem
